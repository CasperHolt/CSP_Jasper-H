        <h1>Coolest monsters in D&D</h1>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <h2>Mimic</h2>
        <p><dt><h3>Discription</h3></dt>
           <dd> A mimic's creepiness lies in its ability to blend seamlessly into its surroundings, transforming from a seemingly ordinary object into a monstrous creature that devours anything it can trap. Its deceptive nature, coupled with the unknown possibilities of its future transformations, creates a chilling sense of dread and unease.</dd>
           <dt><h3>Behavior</h3></dt>
           <dd>Mimics had no concerns beyond surviving and acquiring food. Although some intelligent varieties of mimics were capable of basic communication, they had no culture, no moral code, and no interest in religion. More aggressive mimics could not be reasoned with in any capacity.</dd>
            
           <dt></dt><h3>Abilities</h3></dt>
           <dd>Mimics were capable of altering the pigmentation and texture of their skins by pumping a brown pigmented fluid from internal muscular organs through surface capillary vessels. While the pigment granted them the appearance of wood, the capillaries themselves granted an appearance of wood grain. This fluid could be more readily seen in wounded mimics.</dd>
        
            Their skins were covered with light-sensitive sensors that could detect heat out to a range of 90 feet (27 meters). These sensors were quickly overwhelmed when exposed to bright lights and could potentially even be rendered blind.</p>
